# ðŸ“… Final Log â€“ Project Reflection

**Date**: May 2025  
**Week Number**: Final Week / Project Completion  
**Total Hours**: 150+ hours (cumulative across data cleaning, analysis, visualization, report writing, presentations)

## ðŸŒ¹ Rose (Highlight & Achievement)
The most rewarding part of this capstone project has been successfully extracting meaningful insights from a challenging unstructured dataset and transforming them into actionable recommendations for CATalyst Studios. Despite the complexity of parsing free-text comments to extract balance data, I was able to create a structured analysis that revealed valuable usage patterns across semesters, departments, and demographics.

Seeing the final outcomes â€” a comprehensive report, clear visualizations, and professional presentations â€” come together has been highly satisfying. Presenting this work in WiDS ( Women in Data Science), Tucson conference allowed me to showcase not just technical analysis but also practical, data-driven decision-making applications.

## ðŸŒ± Bud (Looking Ahead / Potential Applications)
Moving forward, Iâ€™m excited about the potential of automating similar data extraction pipelines for unstructured data in other academic or organizational contexts. The methodology applied here â€” using regex for text parsing, exploratory data analysis, and actionable reporting â€” can be adapted to other resource management problems.

I also see opportunities to extend this work by integrating real-time dashboards (if permitted with internal data) and setting up continuous monitoring frameworks for program evaluation at CATalyst Studios.

## ðŸŒµ Thorn (Challenges & Sticking Points)
One of the biggest challenges was handling the inconsistencies in the data format â€” especially the unstructured comment fields used to log balance usage. While regex-based extraction worked effectively, the lack of standardized logging practices made cleaning tedious and iterative.

Additionally, because the dataset is internal and cannot be shared publicly, it limited opportunities to showcase interactive dashboards or open-source code applications externally. Navigating this while still ensuring a meaningful deliverable was an important learning experience.

## Additional Thought
This project has been a comprehensive application of my data analysis skills â€” from data wrangling and visualization to strategic reporting. Over the course of 150+ hours, I have not only deepened my technical expertise but also strengthened my ability to derive actionable business insights from raw data.

Referring to my **final Capstone Report (PDF)** and **Capstone/WIDS Presentations (PPTs)**, this project stands as a culmination of my learning in data-driven problem solving, stakeholder communication, and applied analytics. It has prepared me well for similar real-world data analysis challenges.
