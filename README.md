# 🛠️ CATalyst Makerspace Data Analysis – Capstone Project

## 📊 Overview
This capstone project analyzes student credit utilization at the University of Arizona's CATalyst Studios Makerspace. The objective was to understand how students engage with the $50 material credit program and provide data-driven recommendations for improving program awareness, outreach, and resource planning.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze credit usage trends across semesters and departments.
- Identify programs and demographics with high or low engagement.
- Quantify the financial impact of the credit program.
- Provide actionable recommendations for program optimization.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning, extraction, and exploratory analysis.
- `/visualizations/`: Figures and charts used in reports and presentations.
- `/reports/`: Final Capstone Report (PDF) and WIDS presentation slides.
- `/presentations/`: Final Capstone Presentation PPT.
- `README.md`: This project documentation file.

> **Note**: The raw dataset used for this project is internal to the University of Arizona Libraries and is not publicly shared due to data privacy policies.

## 🛠️ Methodology
- Extracted remaining credit balances from unstructured comment fields.
- Structured the data into an ‘Extracted Final Balance’ column.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify usage patterns by semester, department, and demographic group.
- Calculated total program costs to inform financial planning.
- Summarized insights through visualizations, presentations, and a final report.

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Fall 2024** had the highest average credit usage among students.
